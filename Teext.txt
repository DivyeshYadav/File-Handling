Tigers are carnivorous animals and eat the flesh of other animals using their hunting skills.
 They have an orange or white coat covered in thick black stripes. 
 Tigers can live up to 26 years in jungles and 16-18 years in captivity. 
 They are also great swimmers and enjoy taking a dip in the water of the jungle.
